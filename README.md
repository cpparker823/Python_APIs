In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python library, OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. I created plots to visualize weather patterns and draw conclusions.

I then used my weather data skills to plan future vacations using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. Using Python skills to create map visualiztions.
